# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT SETUP

To set up the development environment, the following steps were taken:

Python Installation: Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed.

Virtual Environment Setup: A virtual environment was created to manage dependencies.

“python -m venv venv”

Activate Virtual Environment:

Windows: “venv\Scripts\activate”

macOS/Linux: “source venv/bin/activate”

Install Required Packages: “pip install -r requirements.txt”

Database Initialization: Start by running the following commands:

“flask db init”: Initializes a new migration environment. Creates a “migrations” directory in the application directory, which will hold all migration scripts and configurations. 

“flask db migrate”: generates a new migration script based on the current state of the application's models. It compares the existing database schema with the defined SQLAlchemy models in the code and creates a script that will update the database to match the models.

“flask db upgrade”: applies the migration script generated by “flask db migrate” to the actual database. It runs the SQL commands specified in the migration script to bring the database schema up to date with the current state of the models.
